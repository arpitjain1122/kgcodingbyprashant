here we are making a container and studying the concept of passing children with props.

we have also used style modules so see that also

we can make any number of containers and it will render the container content in a box as it is defined on Container.module.css.

why to use this ?

in facebook or instagram we have made many cards that are inside a container and we have to post differnt kinds of data without changing the layout. so to reuse this layout we can create a container and pass that new data inside this container and properties (css) will be applied as it is.
